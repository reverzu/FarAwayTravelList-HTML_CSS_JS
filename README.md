✈️ Far Away Travel List ✈️ - Get organized for your next trip!
This project is a recreation of Mr. Jonas Schmedtmann's Far Away Travel List, built entirely from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 💖 It allows you to:

Add items and their quantities to your travel list 📝
Check and uncheck items as you pack them ☑️
Sort items by name or priority 🔃
Enjoy a visual and interactive experience ✨
Features:

Add items with quantity (e.g., "Socks - 3 pairs") 🧦
Mark items as packed and un-packed 🧳
Sort by item name or custom priority ⬆️⬇️
Clear all items easily 🧹
Simple and intuitive interface 😎
This project was inspired by a friend's recommendation of Mr. Schmedtmann's course. It was a great way to practice my web development skills and create a useful tool for travelers.

Feel free to fork this repo and add your own features! 🖖
